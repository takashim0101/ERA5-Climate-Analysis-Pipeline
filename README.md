## Project Classification: Geo-spatial Data Science

This project is a highly interdisciplinary endeavor, strongly incorporating elements from both GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and Data Science. While it cannot be classified solely into one category, its emphasis becomes clear when considering the project's objectives and methodologies.

1.  **Data Science (Machine Learning & Big Data Processing) Elements**
    The **"core methodologies" and "most challenging technical aspects"** of this project belong to Data Science.
    *   **Machine Learning (ML)**: We used the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised learning algorithm, to classify climate patterns. This is a core Data Science technique.
    *   **Big Data Processing**: Dask and xarray were utilized for reading, preprocessing, and memory optimization (chunking) of nearly 700 million spatiotemporal data points. This demonstrates data engineering skills, a prerequisite for large-scale Data Science.
    *   **Statistical Inference**: Monthly averages and standard deviations of temperature and wind speed were calculated, and data was standardized. This is a fundamental aspect of Data Science based on statistics.

2.  **GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Elements**
    The **"data sources" and "final deliverables"** of this project are strongly related to GIS.
    *   **Geospatial Data**: The ERA5 data used is grid data with latitude and longitude coordinates, a central data format handled by GIS.
    *   **Visualization**: Cartopy was used to plot the classified results (clusters) on a map. This is a direct function of GIS, representing data based on geographical information (latitude and longitude).
    *   **Spatial Interpretation**: The final results require geographical analysis and interpretation, answering "which regions in New Zealand belong to which climate pattern."

**Conclusion: Highly Specialized "Geo-spatial Data Science"**
This project is positioned within **"Geo-spatial Data Science,"** a highly recognized and emerging field that merges GIS and Data Science. When presenting this experience for job applications, it demonstrates expertise in both:
*   **Data Science**: Advanced analysis and optimization techniques using SOM and Dask.
*   **GIS**: The ability to handle geospatial data (climate data) and present meaningful results on maps.

Beyond agriculture, this methodology has broad applicability in various sectors:
*   **Environmental Management**: Identifying regions susceptible to specific environmental risks (e.g., drought, flood, pollution patterns) for targeted intervention and policy-making.
*   **Urban Planning**: Analyzing urban climate zones or microclimates to inform sustainable city design, energy efficiency, and public health strategies.
*   **Disaster Preparedness**: Mapping areas prone to certain weather-related disasters to enhance early warning systems and resource allocation.
*   **Renewable Energy**: Optimizing the placement of solar or wind farms by identifying regions with consistent and favorable climate patterns.

## Future Improvements

*   Integrate direct WRF output reading and comparison functionalities.
*   Develop more sophisticated validation metrics and statistical comparison tools.
*   Expand visualization options to include time series analysis and Hovm√∂ller diagrams.
*   Implement a more robust configuration management system for data download and analysis parameters.
